# BMI Calculator Website 

## Introduction

Hello, developers! I’m thrilled to share a project that I recently completed: a BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator. This project calculates the BMI based on the user's weight and height and categorizes the result to help determine the user's health status. It's a simple yet effective tool to practice building interactive web applications with user input.

## Project Overview

The BMI Calculator allows users to input their weight and height, calculates their BMI, and then provides a category (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity) based on the calculated value.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters).
- **BMI Calculation**: Calculates the BMI using the standard formula.
- **Health Category**: Provides a health category based on the calculated BMI.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the DOM.


## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhishekgurjarin/BMI-Calculator.git
    ```

2. **Open the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd BMI-Calculator
    ```

3. **Run the project**:
    - You can either run it on a local server or simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. **Open the website** in a web browser.
2. **Enter your weight and height** into the provided input fields.
3. **Click the "Calculate BMI" button** to see your BMI and health category.

## Conclusion

The BMI Calculator project was a great way to hone my skills in handling user input and performing calculations within a web application. I hope this tool is as useful to you as it was fun for me to build. Feel free to clone the repository and modify the code to add new features or improve existing ones. Happy coding!
